# Atomic Chess Game

## Rules
### Explosive Captures:
When a piece is captured, it triggers an explosion that affects the 8 surrounding squares. All non-pawn pieces in the blast radius, including the capturing piece, are destroyed.

### Pawn Immunity:
Pawns are immune to explosions unless they are directly captured or make the capturing move themselves.

### No King Captures:
Kings are not allowed to make captures.

### King Safety Rule:
A move that would result in both kings being destroyed is not allowed.

### Victory Condition:
The game ends immediately when a king is destroyed; this counts as a capture.
